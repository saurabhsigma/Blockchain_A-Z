Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented programming language primarily used for writing and implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

components of smart contracts include:

state Variables: Data stored on the blockchain
functions: logic for manipulating the state
Events: Logs for off-chain listeners to track actions
